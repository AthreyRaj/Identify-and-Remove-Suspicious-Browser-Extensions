- Google Search for verification

##  Steps Followed

1. Opened the Chrome Extension Manager via `chrome://extensions`.
2. Reviewed the following extensions:
   -  Cisco Webex Extension – Safe, official.
   -  Google Docs Offline – Trusted by Google.
   -  Grammarly – Legitimate writing tool.
   -  Dualless – Removed; unused and minimal benefit.
   -  WPS PDF – Disabled due to excessive permissions and flagged reports.
   -  Norton Safe Web – Disabled; redundant with existing antivirus.

3. Removed/disabled the suspicious ones to enhance privacy and reduce potential attack vectors.

4. Restarted the browser to apply changes.

##  Learnings
